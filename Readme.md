# Society - a small neo4j app

This is an example app to show the possibilities of neo4j-development.
The idea is to have a society with persons which can be part of a group or lead the group.
Furthermore each person can have parents.
The show case is to find all parents if a leader of a group is ill.

**Hint**: You need a running neo4j-server for this app.

## Status
At the moment this sample doesn't work, because I have trouble with Spring Data Neo4j.
See the only test de.stanetz.society.SocietyApplicationTests.
